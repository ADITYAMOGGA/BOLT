The stacked design makes the primary actions extremely obvious.

Promotional & Feature Area (Right side):

Headline and short description explaining a specific feature (“Send larger files on Gmail”).

CTA button (See more features) in a contrasting yellow.

An illustration of a person using a laptop with the Send Anywhere icon speech bubble — adds personality and approachability.

Large bold headings (“Send” / “Receive” and “Want to send larger files on Gmail?”).

Supporting text smaller and lighter for hierarchy.

Shadows on the “Send” and “Receive” boxes for depth.

4. Call-to-Action Strategy
